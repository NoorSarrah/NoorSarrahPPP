Project: HealthVault
HealthVault is a hospital management system designed for nurses to manage hospital data. A user with fast typing skills will be able to navigate through the application with ease and greater efficiency as compared to a normal Graphical User Interface application. This program is written entirely in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

New Feature: Created the Inventory menu and functionalities.

What it does: Provides the ability to add/delete/list inventory items for different nurses.
Justification: Being able to efficiently add/delete/list inventory items allows nurses to quickly get into their workflow with minimal disruption, reducing downtime and wait-time of patients.
Highlights: The Inventory class allows the addition and deletion of the quantity of the items present in the inventory. This is to ensure that the nurses are able to be aware of the inventory stocks.
New Feature: Added the ability to store and load data

What it does: Provides the nurses continuous usage, even after the program is terminated. 
Justification: Being able to efficiently add/delete/list Inventory items allows nurses to quickly get into their workflow with minimal
Highlights: Due to the vulnerabilities of corrupted data files in this enhancement, extra data validation components had to be added to the reading of files. This ensures that the program does not deviate to far from normal operation should somebody tamper with the file.
New Feature: Ability to add and delete quantity of Inventory item.

What it does: Ensures that all items are accounted for, and the inventory stock is always updated.
Justification: Being able to track the inventory stocks, will allow the nurses to be aware if there are any shortage in inventory items.
Highlights: We have to take note of the quantity of the inventory items. We have to ensure that the quantity does not exceed the limit before adding more quantity.
